Zaku, a fast Task Queue for ML Workloads
========================================

To get a quick overview of what you can do with ``zaku``, check out the
following:

-  take a look at the basic tutorial or the tutorial for robotics:

   -  `Zaku Basics <tutorials/basics>`__

-  or try to take a look at the example gallery
   `here <examples/01_simple_queue>`__

Install zaku â€” the latest version is ``{VERSION}`` on
`pypi <https://pypi.org/project/zaku/%7BVERSION%7D/>`__.

.. code-block:: python

   pip install -U 'zaku[all]=={VERSION}'

Supposed you have a JobServer running at ``localhost:9000``.

**Adding Jobs**:

.. code-block:: python

   from zaku import TaskQ

   queue = TaskQ(name="my-test-queue", uri="http://localhost:9000")

   for i in range(100):
       queue.add_job({"job_id": i, "seed": i * 100})

**Retrieving Jobs**:

.. code-block:: python

   from zaku import TaskQ

   queue = TaskQ(name="my-test-queue", uri="http://localhost:9000")

   job_id, job = queue.take()

Now, after you have finished the job, you need to mark the job for
completion. The way we do so is by calling

.. code-block:: python

   queue.mark_done(job_id)

Sometimes when you worker responsible for completeing the job encounters
a failure, you need to also put the job back into the queue so that
other workers can retry. You can do so by calling

.. code-block:: python

   queue.mark_reset()

Now, we offer a context manager ``TaskQ.pop``, which automatically
catches exceptions and resets the job (or marks it complete).

.. code-block:: python

   from zaku import TaskQ

   queue = TaskQ(name="my-test-queue", uri="http://localhost:9000")

   with queue.pop() as job:
     if job is None:
       print("No job available")
     
     print("Retrieved job:", job)

Developing Zaku (Optional)
--------------------------

If you want to develop zaku, you can install it in editable mode plus
dependencies relevant for building the documentations:

.. code-block:: shell

   cd zaku
   pip install -e '.[all]'

To build the documentations, run

.. code-block:: shell

   make docs
